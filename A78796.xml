         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Earle of <hi>Lindſey</hi> and <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> petitioned to his Majeſty both, to return to his Parliament (as was expreſſely intimated in their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) and humbly deſired his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to aſſent unto thoſe Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were ſent by the <hi>Parliament:</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare therein, That they had nothing in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and thoughts more precious and of higher eſteeme (next to the honour and immediate Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Almighty God) then the juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full performance of their duty to his Majeſty, and their fidelity to the Kingdome? Theſe ſaid Earles were ſent for from York to attend the Houſe the precedent Weeke; but they ſhewed the Meſſenger of the Houſe ſpeciall Warrants under his Majeſties Hand, expreſſely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to the contrary, and that ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Majeſty there, till his further pleaſure ſhould be declared unto them.</p>
            <p>But they being very ſenſible of the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:111914:3"/>of this Kingdome, and what irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable danger thoſe inconveniences may produce, if not prevented before they grow to maturity, after a deliberate obſervation of the cauſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, did preſent their dutifull Petition to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the poſture as well of all ſincerity as humility: That out of his Princely Wiſedome, for the eſtabliſhing his own Honours, and Safety, and gracious tenderneſſe of the welfare and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Subjects and Dominions, He would be pleaſed to returne to his <hi>Parliament,</hi> as being the moſt neceſſary and principall mean (through Gods bleſſing) of removing thoſe jealouſies and differences, which have unhappily fallen betwixt him and his People, and as the effectuall way to procure both to his Majeſty and to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> a conſtant courſe of their Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty tooke the Petition very graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and deſired ſome time of ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereon, and then he would give them an effectuall Anſwer. For all the diſtractions, and diſtemper of this Kingdome are derived onely from his Majeſties abſence, and if he would be ſo condeſcentious as to returne, queſtionleſſe theſe ſuſpitions would be expelled, and better opinions entertained. And it is very requiſite, That the great affaire of this Kingdome, may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded or tranſacted by the advice of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Man, or by any unknowne and unſworne Councellor: but that ſuch matters as concerne the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:111914:3"/>State and the publike accommodation of the Realme, are proper for the high Court of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which is his Majeſties great and ſupreme Councell, ought to be debated, reſolved, and tranſacted onely in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and nor elſewhere. And ſuch as ſhall preſume to doe any thing to the contrary, ought to be reſerved to the cenſure and Judgement of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſuch other matters of State as are proper for your Majeſties Privie Councell ought alſo to be debated and concluded by ſuch of the Nobility and other, as ſhall from time to time be choſen for that place, by approbation of both Houſes of <hi>Parliament;</hi> and that no publike Act concerning the Affaires of the Kingdome, which are proper for your Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie Councell may be eſteemed of any validity, as proceeding from the Royall Authority, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be done by the advice and conſent of the Major part of the Councell, atteſted under their Hands.</p>
            <p>And without doubt His Majeſty will conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to ſo faire a propoſition, for the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is his high and chiefe Court and Councell; wherefore it is very expedient, that the doubtfull matters of State ſhould be deſcided, diſcuſſed, and concluded by that high Senate.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty hath alſo ſealed with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and concluded, That the convention of Truce made between <hi>D. Michael de Loronha, Conde de Linhares,</hi> Viceroy of <hi>Goa,</hi> and <hi>William Methuold</hi> Preſident of the Engliſh in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi>

And becauſe the commerce of free comming of the Subjects of the King of great Britaine to the Coaſts and parts of Affrica, the Iſland of Saint <hi>Thome,</hi> and other Iſlands comprehended under them, could not yet be agreed upon by reaſon of the defect of the powers ſent by the moſt renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned King of <hi>Portugall</hi> to his Embaſſadors, that by this debate, this preſent Treatiſe of Peace and Amity between both Kings and their Subjects be not delayed: it is on both parts concluded on, That in the Lands, Places, Caſtles, Ports, and Coaſts of <hi>Affrica, Guyne, Bine, &amp;c.</hi> the Iſland of Saint <hi>Thome,</hi> and other Iſlands comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, wherein it ſhall appeare, That the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> have dwelt, for trade of Merchandiſe, or have had trade or commerce there, in the time of the King of <hi>Caſteele,</hi> or hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto; there ſhall be no alteration or change,
